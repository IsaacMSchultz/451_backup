# YelpApp Bugs

- [x] Categories are not compounded (using or instead of and when querying businesses)
- [x] Categories get lost when an attribute that populates its list is changed.
- [x] Everything gets completely broken if a categories are selected and you de-select a zipcode or city that was the only one had businesses with those categories
- [ ] Friends most recent review grid takes ~10 sec to populate (Use indexing once I learn how to)
