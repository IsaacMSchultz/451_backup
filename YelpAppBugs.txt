YelpApp Bugs:

Friends most recent review grid takes ~10 sec to populate (Use indexing once I learn how to)

Review stars drop down has values listed twice

Adding a business review does not dynamically update the grid until you hit search button (even with updateGrid() call)


Does adding a review check for review_id conflicts (ie: just try catch and try again)
