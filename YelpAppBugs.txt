YelpApp Bugs:

Categories are not compounded (using or instead of and when querying busineses)
A user can create multiple review and map windows
App breaks in ExecuteCategorizedQuery when the user logs and then you go to select a business state (Npgsql.PostgresException: 'External component has thrown an exception.')
	Also happens when querying user after you have already queried business
If a user is not logged in and a user views the map, it is not centeralized on anything
App breaks if a user tries to redisplay the map after viewing it once
If the businesses change, their pins still appear on the map
Friends most recent review grid takes ~10 sec to populate (Use indexing once I learn how to)
The friends most recent review grid query results in the name column repeating twice, even though the query run in pgadmin returns the different names 
When inserting new values, use try catch to prevent primary key conflicts
